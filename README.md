# Classification_Final_Report

### <b>Project Description:</b><br>
This is my final project to find the lead drivers for customer churn at Telco. 

<b>In this project I will construct a ML classification model that can accurately predict Telco's customer churn.</b>

My processees will include utilizing:
  - Jupyter notebook: to log my exploration and report findings
  - Excel: where the Telco data has been created and stored
  - Python: for debugging my code and creating the acquire/prepare files
  - Pandas: used within Jupyter notebook
  - Seaborn: to chart and explore the data
  - Tableau: to present the found data in the Final Report

Included in the Final Report file, I will have a step-by-step process of the key findings of how the key driver(s) were found, the models and their accuracy used in creating the ML machines and what the outcomes vs. my initial hypothesis were.

### <b>Project Goals:</b><br>
To find the drivers of Telco's high churn rate.

### <b>Deliverables:</b><br>
To construct a classification model that will use the found driver(s) to predict Telco's churn rate with 80% accuracy of whether a group of customers will churn or not.
 
 ### <b>Initial Hypothesis and Questions:</b><br>


 ### <b>Project Planning (aka How I think I'll get there!):</b><br>
 <b>STEPS AHEAD:</b><br>
 - Explore these 3 churn drivers
     (ie. charts, crosstabs, hypothesis testing)
 - Create classification models to train, validate, and test drivers on



 <b>MY PROJECT CHECK-LIST:</b><br>
 - Create acquire and prepare.py modules
 - Log down process and questions/takeaways along the way
 - Construct ML models


 - <b> FINAL REPORT: </b><br>
    - use markdown to guide audience
      - (all cells with code need comments!)
    - Begin project with Overview and Goals
    - End project with a Conclusion (how relates to beginning goals)
    - Exploration portion only has charts/data that is important
    - Include 4 visualizations: Question | Visualization | Statistical Test (at least 2 | 
             - <i> must</i> provide markdown for these visuals
    - Provide context of target variable to visualization parameters
    - Include 3 best models 
         - Show steps and code to fit/evaluate/ and select those models
    -On best model, chart visually how it performed on its test
