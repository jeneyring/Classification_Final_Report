# Classification_Final_Report
The Final Report for my Classification Project using classifications-methodologies and algorithms in ML.

<b>GOAL:</b><br>
 To construct a classification model that will predict Telco's churn rate with 80% accuracy whether a group of customers will churn or not.
 
 
 <b>STEPS TO GET THERE:</b><br>
 - Find the top 3 churn drivers of Telco data
 - Explore these 3 churn drivers
     (ie. charts, crosstabs, hypothesis testing)
 - Create classification models to train, validate, and test drivers on
