# Classification_Final_Report
The Final Report for my Classification Project using classifications-methodologies and algorithms in ML.

<b>GOAL:</b><br>
 To construct a classification model that will predict Telco's churn rate with 80% accuracy whether a group of customers will churn or not.
 
 
 <b>STEPS TO GET THERE:</b><br>
 - Find the top 3 churn drivers of Telco data
 - Explore these 3 churn drivers
     (ie. charts, crosstabs, hypothesis testing)
 - Create classification models to train, validate, and test drivers on



 <b>PROJECT CHECK-LIST:</b><br>
 - Create acquire and prepare.py modules
 - Log down process and questions/takeaways along the way
 - Construct ML models
 - <b> Final Report: </b><br>
    - use markdown to guide audience
      - (all cells with code need comments!)
    - Begin project with Overview and Goals
    - End project with a Conclusion (how relates to beginning goals)
    - Exploration portion only has charts/data that is important
    - Include 4 visualizations: Question | Visualization | Statistical Test (at least 2 | 
             - <i> must</i> provide markdown for these visuals
    - Provide context of target variable to visualization parameters
    - Include 3 best models 
         - Show steps and code to fit/evaluate/ and select those models
    -On best model, chart visually how it performed on its test
